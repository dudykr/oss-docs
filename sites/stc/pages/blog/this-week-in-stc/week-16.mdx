This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6023 => 6135,
    Bad (required): 3788 => 3866,
    Bad (excess): 1105 => 867,
    Bad (panic): 100 => 105,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/24599a0028bc1089a940a73df1049a2125cf8d12/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 3/5](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/1fa615e2f3dce751ba0b371ff5cb6122f306c254/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).


## Noticable changes

### Test suite update ([#785](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/785))

We update the test suite to the latest version, and that's why all numbers in the stats got bigger.

### Lots of refactoring

We did lots of refactoring this week, to make the further development easier.
