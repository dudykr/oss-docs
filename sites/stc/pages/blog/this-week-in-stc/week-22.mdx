This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6326 => 6356,
    Bad (required): 3708 => 3678,
    Bad (excess): 772 => 744,
    Bad (panic): 73 => 72,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/82a663b6d6773023969416dcfe84de0cac5f5bd3/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 4/16](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/dce9791936c6488a187fc988d51361b327fe189d/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).
I (`@kdy1`) was too busy because of swc, so I couldn't work on stc a lot.
