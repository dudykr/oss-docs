This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 5912 => 5995,
    Bad (required): 4162 => 3753,
    Bad (excess): 638 => 927,
    Bad (panic): 18 => 228,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/b5f1cf11908d89b2a82854249e6f296a0cb5109a/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 2/19](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/ad91d8ac2936f9befb8dbffb43a687b77402318c/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).
The `Bad (panic)` and `Bad (excess)` regressed because we enabled multi-file tests, but the loader for testing is not fully-featured and panics if it does not know how to load a depdendency.
