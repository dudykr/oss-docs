This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6295 => 6315,
    Bad (required): 3739 => 3719,
    Bad (excess): 820 => 772,
    Bad (panic): 107 => 106,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/0cdf38b9358728c3ac592baf2bbedc31c507be6f/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 4/2](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/e8cf60f9aa3fafb41cbf8261d6b82e60b4ce40f4/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).

Although I (`@kdy1`) was very busy, I and the contributors managed to fix some bugs.
Actually, I'm working on a new log viewer project for stc.
It will take some time, but I'm sure that it will make the development of stc much easier.
