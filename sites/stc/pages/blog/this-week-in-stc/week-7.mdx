This is the status update for [stc][], the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.
Note that preivous status update was skipped, because I was too busy.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    required_error: 4270 => 4245,
    matched_error: 5614 => 5629,
    extra_error: 761 => 743,
    panic: 74 => 72,
}
```

Note: This is the change of two weeks.

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/d6dc481fd29c9e6e93e268dbd4f11a7b3883a6d2/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 1/1](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/977a433daae8d5dd51312e2c8921912008396b17/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug)
