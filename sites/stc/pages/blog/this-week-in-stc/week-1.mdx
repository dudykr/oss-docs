I'm going to provide a weekly update for the status of [stc][].
This is the first post.

## Noticeable changes

- [#284](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/284): Make `fix()` shallow.

This improve performance by margin.
`Type` of `stc` has some invariants to make it easier to handle.
One example of the invariants is that a union cannot include a union as an element, because it causes lots of troubles with the pattern matching of Rust.
There's a function named `fix`, which ensures that a type satisfies all of the invariants.
But previously, it was recursive and it was a costly operation.
It's now shallow and it does not recurse into `Union` nor `Intersection`.
Performance gain is noticeable.
The test execution with a x**debug build** previously took 1m 45s, but it now takes 1m 20s.

- [#275](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/275): Determine project structure for LSP.

My plan is to provide a LSP for TypeScript after fixing all type inference bugs.
I want to make it testable, so I tried various structures.
While triage, I found a project structure which is testable.
I decided to use the `examples` directory of cargo to create a LSP binary which can be used for testing.
Basically, this structure allows **using exactly same code** for testing environment and the release build of stc LSP.

Special thanks to Deno because I referred to the structure of Deno lsp a lot.

- [#245](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/245): Update swc.

This is one of the tasks I wanted to do, but postponed due to the time.
Divy helped a lot, and I managed to update swc crates.
This introduced some regressions, but those are all fixed at the moment.

- [#227](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/227): Fix stack overflow of module loader.

This patch fixes the issue which blocked people from trying stc on their own project.
`stc` could verify a huge TypeScript module if it does not have an import, but this patch reduces the restrictions for real-world project further.
