This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6248 => 6295,
    Bad (required): 3753 => 3739,
    Bad (excess): 703 => 820,
    Bad (panic): 105 => 107,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/6e52c07298905c8507729b7500d6262c28ef6004/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 3/26](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/0cdf38b9358728c3ac592baf2bbedc31c507be6f/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).

Stats regressed because we updated SWC and now the tests for auto-accoessors are marked as extra errors (`Unimplemented`).

## Noticable changes

### SWC update ([#846](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/846))

The previous version of SWC did not support auto-accoessors, but we updated SWC to the latest at the time of authoring PR and now it's parsed.
