This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6135 => 6161,
    Bad (required): 3866 => 3840,
    Bad (excess): 867 => 847,
    Bad (panic): 105 => 107,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/1fa615e2f3dce751ba0b371ff5cb6122f306c254/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 3/12](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/b918d5e0a9cf1a1b1d1cc6e1ff028ba40795817d/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).

There was no many progress this work, but still some progress.
