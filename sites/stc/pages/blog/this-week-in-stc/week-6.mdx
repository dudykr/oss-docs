This is the status update for [stc][], the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    required_error: 4294 => 4270,
    matched_error: 5590 => 5614,
    extra_error: 817 => 761,
    panic: 74,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/23dd114529f10c5d645887c055cd396d1bfe7b11/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on December, 11](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/d6dc481fd29c9e6e93e268dbd4f11a7b3883a6d2/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug)

There were lots of contributors this week.
Thank you!

## Noticeable change

There were no noticable change, but I'm working on [#414: Ignore wrong test refs](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/414), which makes the testing system stricter. I expect a productivity boost from it.
