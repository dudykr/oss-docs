This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6356 => 6377,
    Bad (required): 3678 => 3658,
    Bad (excess): 766,
    Bad (panic): 74,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/dce9791936c6488a187fc988d51361b327fe189d/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 4/23](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/18624b68e031b617b1e697705b1059273a6e7d8a/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).
The stats regressed because we updated our test suite to match the latest version of TypeScript.

# Noticable changes

We are working on a language server for stc. It is still in early stage, and the main goal is to help us to debug the type checker.
