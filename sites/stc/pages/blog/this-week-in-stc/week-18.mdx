This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6161 => 6248,
    Bad (required): 3840 => 3753,
    Bad (excess): 847 => 703,
    Bad (panic): 107 => 105,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/b918d5e0a9cf1a1b1d1cc6e1ff028ba40795817d/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 3/19](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/6e52c07298905c8507729b7500d6262c28ef6004/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).

The stats were drastically improved mainly because there are so many rules that have already been implemented.
**A test passes only when all relevant rules are implemented.**
