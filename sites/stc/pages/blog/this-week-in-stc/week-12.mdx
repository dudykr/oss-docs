This is the status update for [stc][], the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 5891 => 5881,
    Bad (required): 4183 => 4193,
    Bad (excess): 825 => 714,
    Bad (panic): 18,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/14d5ac24b3c4324d6384ae5d207f4fef9e3ae1fb/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 2/5](). I took vacation this week, so there was a lot of progress.

There was one contributor this week, but he's a long-term contributor and he contributed a lot of code. Thank you!

## Noticable changes

### Change of the testing strategy

I'm working to split the official conformance test suite from `tsc` into smaller unit tests. Once it's finished, progress will be much faster.
