This is the status update for [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    Matched: 6315 => 6326,
    Bad (required): 3719 => 3708,
    Bad (excess): 772,
    Bad (panic): 106 => 73,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/e8cf60f9aa3fafb41cbf8261d6b82e60b4ce40f4/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 4/9](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/82a663b6d6773023969416dcfe84de0cac5f5bd3/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).
We fixed lots of excess errors, but the number regressed while fixing panics.
