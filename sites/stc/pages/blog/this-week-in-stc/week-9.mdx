This is the status update for [stc][], the new TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## TL;DR;

Stats:

```
Stats {
    required_error: 4237 => 4291,
    matched_error: 5647 => 5814,
    extra_error: 735 => 1118,
    panic: 71 => 29,
}
```

This is the diff for [the commit used for previous status update](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/b021e8958481fedb12c648f070963b59ccb28128/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug) and [the last commit on 1/15](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/fcf2e3c58eca78aa46fdbe4c16435225b9a2a663/crates/stc_ts_type_checker/tests/tsc-stats.rust-debug).
We changed the way we count the number of errors to make it represent the actual progress more closely.

There were lots of Contributions this week.
Thank you!

## Noticable changes

### Change the way we count errors ([#487](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/487))

There are matrix tests in the test suite of `tsc`.
Those tests have one input, but have multiple results, depending on the directives like `@target: es5, es2015, esnext`.
Previously, we counted them as one test.
But we now count the matrix tests, which has multiple result, once per the result.
That's the main reason why the number of `extra_error` increased.


### Remove panic ([#468](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/468), [#493](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/pull/493))

We replaced `panic!` calls with `Unimplemented` errors to make the stats more accurate.
