The faster TypeScript type checker written in Rust.


## Reading stats in status updates

You will see `Stats` in status updates, like

```rust
{
    required_error: 4463,
    matched_error: 5421,
    extra_error: 999,
    panic: 89,
}
```

 - `required_error` means a true negative, which is a type error that is not reported by `stc`.

 - `matched_error` means a true positive, which is a type error that is reported by `stc` and correct.

 - `extra_error` means a false positive. In other words, it's the number of incorrect errors `stc` emits while it should not.

 - `panic` means the analyzer panicked while validating input files, due to a logic bug.
