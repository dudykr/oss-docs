The fastest TypeScript type checker written in Rust.

## Status

`stc` is under active development.
To provide an estimate of the progress, we have a stats.


<Stats />

 - `required_error` means a true negative, which is a type error that is not reported by `stc`.

 - `matched_error` means a true positive, which is a type error that is reported by `stc` and correct.

 - `extra_error` means a false positive. In other words, it's the number of incorrect errors `stc` emits while it should not.

 - `panic` means the analyzer panicked while validating input files, due to a logic bug.
