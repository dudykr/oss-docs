## Configuring development environment

1. Clone stc.
2. Run `yarn` in the cloned directory.
3. (mac only) Install `zld`

```sh
brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld
```

## Testing system

If the filename of a test case file described below starts with `.`, it means it's ignored.

## Project structure

### crates/stc_ts_file_analyzer

Frequently used scripts:

- `./scripts/fast.sh`

If no argument is specified, this runs all `base` tests declared in the file analyzer crate.
This script is fast, so you can run it frequently.

**Note**: This command does not enable logging because it's too verbose.

---

- `./scripts/base.sh`

If no argument is specified, this runs all `base` tests declared in the file analyzer crate.
This command is slow, so it's recommended to use it like

```bash
./scripts/base.sh pass_only_tests__pass_only__conformance__types__tuple__variadicTuples1__3_ts
```

You can get the test name by invoking `./scripts/fast.sh`, `./scripts/test.sh` (from stc_ts_type_checker), or `./scripts/check.sh` (from stc_ts_type_checker).

---

- `./scripts/auto-unignore.sh`

This command can be used to select a task to work on, or verify that your change make more `pass-only`/`errors` tests pass.

**Note**: This command does not enable logging because it's too verbose.

#### tests/base.rs

This test file declares 5 testing systems, `pass`, `pass-only`, `errors`, `tsc`, and `visualize`.
You should prefer shell scripts in `scripts` directory over direct `cargo test` invokation.

#### tests/pass-only

Any TypeScript file in this directory will be evaluated, and the test systme will ensure that `stc` doesn't emit any error.

#### tests/pass

Any TypeScript file in this directory will be evaluated, the test systme will ensure that `stc` doesn't emit any error, and the type of expressions are printed to a `.swc-stderr` file.

#### tests/errors

Any TypeScript file in this directory will be evaluated, and the test systme will ensure that `stc` emit at least one error.
In future, we will check the error message as well.

#### tests/tsc

Any TypeScript file in this directory will be evaluated, and the result will be compared with the official TypeScript compiler.

#### tests/visualize

Any TypeScript file in this directory will be evaluated, and the type of expressions are printed to a `.swc-stderr` file.

### crates/stc_ts_type_checker

- `./scripts/check.sh`

You can invoke this script to run all conformance tests, and update stats.

**Note**: This command invokes base tests described above, and aborts if it fails.

---

- `./scripts/test.sh`

You can invoke single conformance test case by using `./scripts/test.sh` from `./crates/stc_ts_type_checker`.

```bash
./scripts/test.sh staticIndexSignature
```

will run conformance tests which have `staticIndexSignature` in their test name.

**Note**: This command invokes base tests described above, and aborts if it fails.

#### tests/tsc.rs

This test suite declares the test suite ported from the official TypeScript compiler, `tsc`.
You are not expected to run this test via `cargo test` directly, and instead you should use `./scripts/test.sh` or `./scripts/check.sh`.

## Workflows

Regardless of the workflow you choose, you should run `./scripts/check.sh` when you are done.

### Using unit test (in file analyzer)

You can run

```bash
./scripts/auto-unignore.sh
```

to get list of tasks to work on.
Select one test input file from the terminal, and reanme it to not have `.` as prefix in their filename.

e.g.

- `.foo/1.ts` => `foo/1.ts`
- `foo/.1.ts` => `foo/1.ts`

Then, you can run

```bash
./scripts/fast.sh
```

to run the tests in a timely manner, or

```bash
./scripts/base.sh $test_name
```

to get log messages.

### Using conformance test suite

First, you should find a erroneous test case.
Typically, you can find one by running `./scripts/check.sh` from `./crates/stc_ts_type_checker`.
It will print enormous amount of log.
You should focus on false-positives.
Each error will contain lots of information required for debugging, with `context:` prefix.

If you want, you can copy the file to `./crates/stc_ts_file_analyzer/tests/...` and run `./scripts/fast.sh` from the file analyzer.
It's recommended to reduce the test input as much as possible, because `stc` prints enormous amount of log messages in a debug build.

Otherwise, you can use `./scripts/test.sh` from `./crates/stc_ts_type_checker` to run a single test case.
As `./scripts/test.sh` prints log messags, debugging will be easier.

### Finding test cases with specific excessive errors

You can run `./scripts/errors/find-extra.sh TS2322` from `./crates/stc_ts_type_checker` to find all false-positive `TS2322` errors.

## Debugging tips

### Rustdoc

You can look at [the rustdoc for `Analyzer`](https://rustdoc.stc.dudy.dev/stc_ts_file_analyzer/analyzer/struct.Analyzer.html) to get list of implemented operations.

### Debugging with vscode Debugger

Please copy `.vscode/launch.template.json` and rename it to `.vscode/launch.json`.

In `launch.json`, you can pass the path of the `.ts` file you want to check to the `args` field.
Then, you can run the type checker with debugger from the debugger panel.

### `print_backtrace()`

If you think some code should not be invoked but seems like it's invoked, you can use `print_backtrace()`.
It will print the stack trace of the current thread.
Note that it will automatically exclude useless items from the stack trace.

### Matching over `Type`

To avoid performance drop caused by cloning, `stc` uses `Type::Arc` to share memory.
But there's a downside for this - you have to call `normalize()` while matching.

e.g.

```rust
match ty.normalize() {
}
```

Note that this is different from `self.normalize(ty)` of `Analyzer`, which is used to expand special types like references, queries, mapped, etc..

### Finding problematic code

Look at the `context:` in the error output, and search it from repository using substring of the context.
e.g. `tried to assign to a template type` means the error comes from [analyzer/assign/mod.rs#L2208](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/blob/1c73ce5fa87ec789ead108c5c6876e8089b1e5de/crates/stc_ts_file_analyzer/src/analyzer/assign/mod.rs#L2208)

## Troubleshooting

### Windows - `unstable on this platform`

In case if you're using Windows and getting an error

```sh
error: `-Csplit-debuginfo=unpacked` is unstable on this platform
```

as a workaround you can try using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

### `failed to execute command`

If you're getting something like

```sh
--- stderr
  thread 'main' panicked at 'failed to execute command: No such file or directory (os error 2)', /home/ubuntu/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/tikv-jemalloc-sys-0.5.2+5.3.0-patched/build.rs:326:19
```

try running `apt-get install make`. ([related issue](https://github.com/gnzlbg/jemallocator/issues/148#issuecomment-619373613))
