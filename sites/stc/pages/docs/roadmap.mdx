# Roadmap to the alpha

`(*)` in title means it's subject to change.



## Plans

### A new language server    

This is the primary goal, and once this is ready, the alpha will be released.

For this, 

 - the inference of types should be correct
 - there should be no false-positive errors
 - typings should be loaded correctly

### Only `isolatedModules: true`

Ref: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules

This is required for proper parallelization. `const enums` are fine if they are imported using module syntax, but **TypeScript namespaces cannot be analyzed in parallel**.

### (*) A compiler for typings

 - This is subject to change.

Many typing packages, including `@types/node`, cannot be analyzed in parallel because they use `namespace` and globals.
So we can use only one thread for each typing package.
But actually, this operation is easily cachable, and I expect the effect of caching to be significant.
So I think it's worth it to provide a pre-compile API for typing packages.
