# Roadmap to the alpha


## Plans

`*` in title means it's subject to change.

### Only `isolatedModules: true`

Ref: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules

This is required for proper parallelization. `const enums` are fine if they are imported using module syntax, but TypeScript **namespace cannot be analyzed in parallel**.

### (*) A compiler for typings

 - This is subject to change.

Many typing packages, including `@types/node`, cannot be analyzed in parallel because they use `namespace` and globals.
So we can use only one thread for each typing package.
But actually, this operation is easily cachable, and I expect the effect of caching to be significant.
So I think it's worth it to provide a pre-compile API for typing packages.
